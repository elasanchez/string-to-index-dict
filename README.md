# string-to-index-dict
A simple C++ implementation to imitate one of the functionality of python's "defaultdict" from "collections"

This program is meant to be compiled as a library to be used to perform the following:
        Given a string "radar" we turn this string into a dictionary as such,
        
        {   a: [1,2],
            d: [2],
            r: [0,4] }
            
The inspiration behind this is to imitate a functionality of python's defaultdict function from collections library.
